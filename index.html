            <h3>About the MAN :</h3>
            ðŸ’€David Goggins was born on February 17, 1975, to Trunnis and Jackie Goggins. In 1981, Goggins lived in
            Williamsville, New York with his parents and brother, Trunnis Jr. As a six-year-old, Goggins worked with his
            family at his father's skate rink. Goggins and other members of his family suffered constant and severe
            abuse
            from his father before escaping from him along with his mother, something which he talks about in the book
            Can't
            Hurt Me.
            <br><br>

            ðŸ’€Goggins initially applied to join the United States Air Force Pararescue, and was accepted into training
            after
            failing his ASVAB twice. During the training he had been diagnosed with sickle cell trait and was removed
            from
            training; he was given the option to restart the training upon his return but chose not to.[7][8] He then
            completed United States Air Force Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) training, and worked as a TACP from 1994
            until 1999, when he left the United States Air Force.[5] After three attempts, Goggins succeeded in
            graduating
            from BUD/S training with BUD/S class 235 in 2001. Following SEAL Qualification Training (SQT) and completion
            of
            six month probationary period, he received the NEC 5326 as a Combatant Swimmer (SEAL), entitled to wear the
            Special Warfare insignia also known as "SEAL Trident". Goggins was assigned to SEAL Team 5. In his 20-year
            military career, Goggins served in Iraq and Afghanistan.[9] In 2004, Goggins graduated from Army Ranger
            School,
            and received the "Top Enlisted Man" award.
            <br><br>

            ðŸ’€After several of his friends died in Afghanistan in a helicopter crash in 2005 during Operation Red
            Wings,[10] Goggins began long-distance running with the aim of raising money for the Special Operations
            Warrior Foundation. The Foundation gives college scholarships and grants to the children of fallen special
            operations soldiers.[11] Competing in endurance challenges, including the Badwater Ultramarathon three
            times, has enabled Goggins to raise more than US$2 million for the Special Operations Warrior Foundation.
            <br><br>

            ðŸ’€In 2008 he was named a "Hero of Running" by Runner's World.[17] In 2016, Goggins won the Infinitus 88k in
            12 hours, almost twenty minutes ahead of the next finisher. In the same year, he also won the Music City
            Ultra 50k, and Strolling Jim 40 Miler.[18] In 2020, Goggins ran the Moab 240 ultramarathon, placing 2nd in
            the 241 mile event with a time of 63 hours and 21 minutes, approximately 95 minutes behind race winner
            Michele Graglia.
